The **service** can communicate with the X11 windowing system and a multitude of Wayland compositors.

The **library** provides convenient objects and methods for writing frontend GUI applications that interact with the service. The reference implementation is [KDisplay](https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kdisplay).
