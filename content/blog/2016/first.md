So, here we have one more programmer's blog. It's mainly for documenting my successes and defeats in the conquest of becoming better in [Linux][flip], [KDE][kde-dies], [Qt][cute] development.

But sometimes I'll probably talk also about other stuff: Maybe [politics][trumpkiss], maybe [religion][popekiss], maybe [your mum][yourmumkiss]. But most certainly [mathematics][math]. Enjoy!

By the way: The blog is made for now with [Jekyll][jekyll] (like it seems to me most programmer's blogs are nowadays) and I used the [Gaya theme][gaya]. Thank you [Gayan][gayan]!
