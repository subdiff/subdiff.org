[Last week](kwinft-becomes-theseus-ship) I said that there would be something big to announce soon. Now is the time for that. With the first release of
[The Compositor Modules](https://github.com/winft/como/) I plan to offer the most modular and feature-rich library solution to easily build Wayland and X11 compositors for any desktop and embedded use case.

To learn more about The Compositor Modules read my announcement article, being published exclusively [on Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/the-compositor-modules-como).
